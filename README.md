## Aims:
- To show which factors in the data determine the body mass of individuals within a population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries)
- Writing and documenting concise R code
    - Data tidying , visualisation, normalisation and statistical modelling
- Presenting results in Rmarkdown

# Background
Data have been collected between 1980 and 2020 on the masses of individuals (in KG). Individuals have been caught once per year, weighed, sexed, and the number of offspring they have had been recorded. 

# Files
- sheep_body_mass_code.Rmd: All the code required for statistical analysis of the sheep data
- markdown.html: An HTML file of the Rmarkdown document, open in browser using a PDF viewer
